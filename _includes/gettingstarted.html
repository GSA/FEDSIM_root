            <h4 class="whitetext">Interagency Agreement</h4>
            <p>FEDSIM’s authority for Interagency Agreements is derived from:</P>
                <ul>
                    <li>USC 11302(e) (OMB’s executive agent designation) and/or the Acquisition Services Fund, 40 SC § 321.</li>
                    <li>USC § 501-502 (for personal property and non-personal services).</li>
                    <li>USC § 11314 (for some aspects of technology).</li>
                </ul>
            <p>These statutory authorities are independent of the Economy Act and therefore, the Economy Act does not apply.</p>
