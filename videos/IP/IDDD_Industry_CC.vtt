1
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.420
So you've been invited to a FEDSIM

2
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.780
Due Diligence session.

3
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.080
How do you make it count?

4
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.940
The purpose of Due Diligence is

5
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.890
for you to become more familiar with the

6
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.320
upcoming solicitation so you can decide to bid.

7
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.100
Or if you already know that you will bid,

8
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.560
Due Diligence will help you

9
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.900
propose a competitive solution.

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.300
The format of Due Diligence is a 45 to 60

11
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.800
minute one-on-one meeting with the government.

12
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.739
At Due Diligence you can ask

13
00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.660
tailored questions and provide feedback

14
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.309
to the entire government acquisition

15
00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.379
team on the clarity of the draft

16
00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.210
solicitation and any supporting

17
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.880
documents received in the advance notice

18
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.100
One benefit of attending a Due Diligence

19
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.199
session is the ability to meet the

20
00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.480
acquisition team one on one without your

21
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.860
competitors present to further

22
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.600
understand the challenges the government

23
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.140
is trying to solve with this solicitation.

24
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.800
It's also your opportunity

25
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.899
to meet the individual participants who

26
00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.970
helped draft the solicitation and its

27
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.080
evaluation requirements.

28
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.920
Your questions will not be shared with other industry

29
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.229
partners and your feedback may result in

30
00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.060
helping the government further define,

31
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.549
clarify and shape the requirements

32
00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.900
before the final release solicitation.

33
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.400
You may be wondering if Due Diligence is allowed.

34
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.160
In fact, the FAR encourages it.

35
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.119
We're not sure why it hasn't caught on

36
00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.590
with the rest of the government but

37
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.040
we're working on that.

38
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.280
However, there are some ground rules.

39
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.380
First and foremost, this is not a corporate capabilities

40
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.220
corporate capabilities briefing.

41
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.790
Your time to wow the client

42
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.680
with the fancy sprockets, logos, and

43
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.000
innovative strategies was two months ago.

44
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.440
We are focused on the requirements

45
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.740
in this meeting, not how you can price to

46
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.100
win the contract.

47
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.960
We control for that anyway by using cost ranges

48
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.100
so it would be a waste of time.

49
00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.820
If you ask cost or price questions they won't be answered.

50
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.530
We also won't answer questions about

51
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.750
technical evaluation criteria or

52
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.580
questions related to approval of a

53
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.470
potential solution or approach and

54
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.040
current contract performance.

55
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.260
Finally, we are also big on this being a

56
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.630
conversation, so please do not bring any

57
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.900
electronics into the session.

58
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.520
You are allowed to ask any technical questions

59
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.709
regarding the environment, the draft

60
00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.980
documents, and the requirements.

61
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.840
We also encourage non-technical questions about

62
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.610
contract type, timelines for

63
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.920
solicitation release or questions about

64
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.340
business drivers.

65
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.340
We want to know if anything is unclear, is unduly

66
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.660
restrictive or limits your ability to

67
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.320
develop a solution.

68
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.860
Make your session count.

69
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.120
Bring folks from different disciplines.

70
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.700
Ask more questions than you

71
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.120
would during Q&A.

72
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.280
If you've already formed a team,

73
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.020
feel free to come together.

74
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.940
This is your opportunity to meet

75
00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.340
one-on-one with the government and

76
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.500
client to shape the requirements prior

77
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.020
to the formal solicitation process.

78
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.800
For any specific questions, please contact

79
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.000
your FEDSIM Contracting Officer.
