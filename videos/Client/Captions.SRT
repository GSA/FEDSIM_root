[GSA FEDSIM logo appears followed by text which reads "Introduction to the

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:10,920
Technical Evaluation Board." Chris Hamm,
FEDSIM director narrates.] Welcome to the

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,020
TEB also known as the Technical
Evaluation Board. As an evaluating member

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:21,210
of the TEB, there are a few things you
need to know. Your role is to evaluate

5
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,800
all proposals fairly and evenly and then
recommend the technically superior

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,720
proposal, which you'll accomplish by
reviewing the written technical part

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,750
first, then the oral presentations or the
video technical proposal. Of course, you

8
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:42,780
won't be on your own. The TEB consists of these voting members: a FEDSIM TEB chair,

9
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,450
an Assistant Acquisition Project Manager,
the FEDSIM project manager, and other

10
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,940
representatives from your agency. The TEB may also include technical advisors to

11
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,230
bring specialized knowledge to the
evaluation and observers who may observe

12
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,870
the process but will not provide ratings.
Only the voting members, the TEB Chair,

13
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,880
Assistant APM and client representatives
like you will evaluate proposals and

14
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,030
assign ratings. Many government entities
use different approaches to evaluation.

15
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:20,040
Some use a color rating scale. Others use
a mathematical evaluation approach to

16
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,820
reach an award decision. All
methodologies can be challenged in a

17
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,110
protest. Over time, FEDSIM has fine-tuned the evaluation

18
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,110
methodology to reduce risk and drive
quality outcomes.

19
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:36,840
That's why FEDSIM uses an adjectival
scheme for evaluating proposals.

20
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,380
Adjectival ratings differentiate the
technical qualitative differences that

21
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,750
can drive a best value award. This
approach adheres to the FAR and

22
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:49,770
distinguishes best quality, lowest risk
offers from the others. [On screen text

23
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,869
reads: "Preparing for evaluations"] To
prepare for the TEB evaluation, you

24
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:58,469
should read and understand the
solicitation and read the technical

25
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:02,420
evaluation plan to familiarize yourself
with the desired proposal qualities,

26
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:08,420
strengths, weaknesses, and deficiencies
and the adjectival ratings.

27
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:14,030
During the TEB training, your APM will
review this document in more detail.

28
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:18,770
The TEB's goal is to assign an adjectival
rating to each proposal. These ratings

29
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:23,690
will help identify the superior proposal.
To get there, you will first complete an

30
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:27,950
individual evaluation of the material
and presentations, documenting feedback

31
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:32,870
on the overall proposal while also
writing SWD statements against each

32
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:38,000
evaluation factor. Then you will convene
as a group to review the individual

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,610
evaluation statements to come to a
consensus on them. The TEB will assign

34
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:47,959
adjectival ratings for each proposal
factor and then assign an overall

35
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:51,459
proposal adjectival rating.

36
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:57,470
Once this is repeated for each proposal,
the APM documents the findings in the

37
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,920
TEB consensus report.

38
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,780
Some of these days
can get rather long, which is why FEDSIM

39
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,700
strives to make evaluations as fast and
efficient as possible. To help us do that,

40
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:18,109
delegate other client duties so that you
can focus on the evaluation.

41
00:03:18,109 --> 00:03:21,620
Your TEB Chair will be in touch with you
about the required TEB training you need

42
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:26,390
prior to the start of the technical
evaluation. [End titles appear with the

43
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:33,130
GSA FEDSIM logo, which reads: "Introduction
to the Technical Evaluation Board."
