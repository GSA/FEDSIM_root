00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.810
Welcome to the TEB, also known as the Technical Evaluation Board. As an

2
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.170
evaluating member of the TEB, there are few things you need to know. Your role is

3
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.869
to evaluate all proposals fairly and evenly and then recommend the

4
00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.869
technically superior proposal, which is accomplished by reviewing the written

5
00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.600
technical part first then the oral presentations or the video technical

6
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.600
proposal. Of course, you won't be on your own. The TEB consists of these voting

7
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.600
members: The TEB chair, an Assistant Acquisition Project Manager, the FEDSIM

8
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.580
project manager, and other representatives from your agency. The TEB

9
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.330
may also include technical advisers to bring specialized knowledge to the

10
00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.270
evaluation and observers who may observe the process but will not provide ratings.

11
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.270
Only the voting members - the TEB chair, Assistant APM, and client representatives

12
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.100
like you will evaluate proposals and assign ratings. Many government entities

13
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.930
use different approaches to evaluation. Some use a color grading scale, others

14
00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.070
use a mathematical evaluation approach to reach an award decision. All

15
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.070
methodologies can be challenged in a protest. Over time, FEDSIM has fine tuned the

16
00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:32.490
evaluation methodology to reduce risk and drive quality outcomes. That's why

17
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.490
FEDSIM uses an adjectival scheme for evaluating proposals. Adjectival ratings differentiate the

18
00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:43.149
technical qualitative differences that can drive a best value award. This

19
00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.179
approach adheres to the FAR and distinguishes best quality, lowest risk

20
00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:52.179
offers from the others. To prepare for the TEB evaluation you should read and

21
00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:57.920
understand the solicitation and read the Technical Evaluation Plan to familiarize

22
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.780
yourself with the desired proposal qualities, strengths, weaknesses, risks, and

23
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.780
deficiencies (also known as SWRDs), and the adjectival ratings. During the

24
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.630
TEB training, your APM will review this document in more detail.

25
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.630
The TEB's goal is to assign an adjectival rating to each proposal. These ratings

26
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.230
will help identify the superior proposal. To get there, you will first complete an individual

27
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.600
evaluation of the material and presentations, documenting feedback on

28
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.600
the overall proposal while also writing SWRD statements against each evaluation

29
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.780
factor. Then you will convene as a group to review the individual evaluation

30
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.750
statements and SWRDs to come to a consensus on them.

31
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.750
The TEB will assign adjectival ratings for each proposal factor and then

32
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.890
assign an overall proposal adjectival rating. Once this is repeated

33
00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.170
for each proposal, the APM documents the findings in the TEB consensus report.

34
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.760
Some of these days can get rather long which is why FEDSIM strives to make

35
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.270
evaluations as fast and efficient as possible. To help us do that,

36
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.720
delegate other client duties so that you can focus on the evaluation.

37
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.230
The TEB chair will be in touch with you about the required TEB training you need

38
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.299
prior to the start of the Technical Evaluation.
