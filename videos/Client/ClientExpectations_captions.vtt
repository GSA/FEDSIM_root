In post award, there are a number of tasks for each Award Fee period.

8
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.830
It's a lot of work, but your FEDSIM project manager,

9
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.260
with support behind the scenes, covers most of them.

10
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.260
These are the ones that require your action and attention: Setting your

11
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.250
Service Level Agreements, in which

12
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.739
you suggest and tailor the measures, aligning them with your goals and

13
00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:51.510
outcomes;

14
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.940
setting weights to make sure that we're emphasizing the right measures;

15
00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.250
adjusting SLAs and benchmarking new measures;

16
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.250
providing routine feedback to tell FEDSIM if the SLAs are working

17
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.480
and if the performance is meeting your SLAs;

18
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.160
participating in the award fee

19
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.640
evaluation board meeting every six months

20
00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:17.240
and actively helping determine what the contractor's performance rating is;

21
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.940
and after we're all done with the Award Fee process,

22
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.080
concurring on the Award Fee invoice.

23
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.790
