1
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.740
For an acquisition shop we do things a little differently.

2
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.120
We believe in effectively communicating

3
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.940
with potential bidders and getting feedback

4
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.000
before we reach the altar.

5
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.740
One of the best ways to

6
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.760
accelerate our acquisition schedule is

7
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.439
to actually communicate face-to-face

8
00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.420
with the people and firms that will

9
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.260
ultimately do the work.

10
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.240
Your upcoming Due Diligence session will be your first

11
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.000
chance to see this in action.

12
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.140
Due Diligence sessions are one-on-one

13
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.400
face-to-face meetings with industry partners.

14
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.500
FEDSIM finds these sessions to be

15
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.120
the most effective means of communication.

16
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.820
It allows the acquisition team

17
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.600
to assess the interaction and

18
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.520
communication of each offeror.

19
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.300
This is an opportunity for the government to assess

20
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.250
the quality of the draft solicitation

21
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.379
based on the number and types of

22
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.560
questions industry asks.

23
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.420
It also gives you an opportunity to communicate

24
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.820
themes and priorities, and to clarify your

25
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.480
requirements.

26
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.420
Your role in Due Diligence is not only to sit and

27
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.700
listen to questions, but also to engage in dialogue

28
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.200
with industry.

29
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.940
FEDSIM encourages bringing personnel who are

30
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.180
the subject matter experts and stakeholders

31
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.640
to participate in these sessions if they will be

32
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.980
involved in the evaluation process.

33
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.900
Even if some content isn't relevant to their

34
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.570
area of expertise, their skilled response

35
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.340
to a technical or program management

36
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.619
question can make all the difference to

37
00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.450
industry partners seeking to fully

38
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.670
understand the solicitation response you

39
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.860
are looking for.

40
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.060
It's worth the personnel investment

41
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.900
on the front end of the project.

42
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.160
We've been working on the draft

43
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.220
solicitation for some time now,

44
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.280
so it's natural to believe we're ninety-five

45
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.380
percent complete.

46
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.680
But what was clear to us

47
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.220
could very well be ambiguous to industry.

48
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.940
Engaging in dialogue helps

49
00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.360
clarify requirements and enables the

50
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.780
finalization of the solicitation.

51
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.460
While Due Diligence may seem unusual,

52
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.039
FAR 15.201 advocates one-on-one exchanges

53
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.880
prior to the solicitation.

54
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.160
Even OMB has reinforced one-on-one meetings with

55
00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.000
industry in their 2011 myth-busting memo.

56
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.460
FEDSIM won the first award for myth-busting

57
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.700
the next year.

58
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.440
These pre-proposal meetings with industry facilitate

59
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.620
bid/no bid decisions, encourage competition,

60
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.260
and result in better technical

61
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.860
approaches and solutions.

62
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.000
There are ground rules that we share with industry

63
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.520
beforehand, and we have proof that it works.

64
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.120
In fact, FEDSIM has been protested

65
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.080
dozens of times and Due Diligence has

66
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.140
never been part of the protest.

67
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.140
Of course, there are boundaries to what can be

68
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.209
discussed in Due Diligence such as

69
00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.000
current contract performance,

70
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.040
cost or price, technical evaluation criteria or

71
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.120
approval of a particular approach or solution.

72
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.880
Outside of these boundaries

73
00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.470
this is your opportunity to signal

74
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.150
messages to industry about your

75
00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.840
priorities and goals.

76
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.460
For any specific questions, please contact your

77
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.660
FEDSIM Contracting Officer.
